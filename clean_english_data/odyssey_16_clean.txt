 Meanwhile the two in the hut Odysseus and the goodly swineherd had kindled a fire and were making ready their breakfast at dawn and had sent forth the herdsmen with the droves of swine but around Telemachus the baying hounds fawned  and barked not as he drew near And goodly Odysseus noted the fawning of the hounds and the sound of footsteps fell upon his ears and straightway he spoke to Eumaeus winged words Eumaeus surely some comrade of thine will be coming or at least some one thou knowest for the hounds do not bark  but fawn about him and I hear the sound of footsteps Not yet was the word fully uttered when his own dear son stood in the doorway In amazement up sprang the swineherd and from his hands the vessels fell with which he was busied as he mixed the flaming wine And he went to meet his lord  and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes and his two hands and a big tear fell from him And as a loving father greets his own dear son who comes in the tenth year from a distant land his only son and well-beloved for whose sake he has borne much sorrow   even so did the goodly swineherd then clasp in his arms godlike Telemachus and kiss him all over as one escaped from death and with wailing he addressed him with winged words Thou art come Telemachus sweet light of my eyes I thought I should never see thee more after thou hadst gone in thy ship to Pylos  But come enter in dear child that I may delight my heart with looking at thee here in my house who art newly come from other lands For thou dost not often visit the farm and the herdsmen but abidest in the town so I ween has it seemed good to thy heart to look upon the destructive throng of the wooers  Then wise Telemachus answered him So shall it be father It is for thy sake that I am come hither to see thee with my eyes and to hear thee tell whether my mother still abides in the halls or whether by now some other man has wedded her and the couch of Odysseus  lies haply in want of bedding covered with foul spider-webs Then the swineherd a leader of men answered him Aye verily she abides with steadfast heart in thy halls and ever sorrowfully for her the nights and the days wane as she weeps  So saying he took from him the spear of bronze and Telemachus went in and passed over the stone threshold As he drew near his father Odysseus rose from his seat and gave him place but Telemachus on his part checked him and said Be seated stranger and we shall find a seat elsewhere  in our farmstead There is a man here who will set us one So he spoke and Odysseus went back and sat down again and for Telemachus the swineherd strewed green brushwood beneath and a fleece above it and there the dear son of Odysseus sat down Then the swineherd set before them platters  of roast meats which they had left at their meal the day before and quickly heaped up bread in baskets and mixed in a bowl of ivy wood honey-sweet wine and himself sat down over against divine Odysseus So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them  But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink Telemachus spoke to the goodly swineherd and said Father from whence did this stranger come to thee How did sailors bring him to Ithaca Who did they declare themselves to be For nowise methinks did he come hither on foot  To him then swineherd Eumaeus didst thou make answer and say Then verily my child I will tell thee all the truth From broad Crete he declares that he has birth and he says that he has wandered roaming through many cities of mortals so has a god spun for him this lot  But now he has run away from a ship of the Thesprotians and come to my farmstead and I shall put him in thy hands Do what thou wilt He declares himself thy suppliant Then again wise Telemachus answered him Eumaeus verily this word which thou hast uttered stings me to the heart  For how am I to welcome this stranger in my house I am myself but young nor have I yet trust in my might to defend me against a man when one waxes wroth without a cause And as for my mother the heart in her breast wavers this way and that whether to abide here with me and keep the house  respecting the bed of her husband and the voice of the people or to go now with him whosoever is best of the Achaeans that woo her in the halls and offers the most gifts of wooing But verily as regards this stranger now that he has come to thy house I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic fair raiment  and will give him a two-edged sword and sandals for his feet and send him whithersoever his heart and spirit bid him go Or if thou wilt do thou keep him here at the farmstead and care for him and raiment will I send hither and all his food to eat that he be not the ruin of thee and of thy men  But thither will I not suffer him to go to join the company of the wooers for they are over-full of wanton insolence lest they mock him and dread grief come upon me And to achieve aught is hard for one man among many how mighty soever he be for verily they are far stronger  Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered him Friend since surely it is right for me to make answer verily ye rend my heart as I hear your words such wantonness you say the wooers devise in the halls in despite of thee so goodly a man  Tell me art thou willingly thus oppressed Or do the people throughout the land hate thee following the voice of a god Or hast thou cause to blame thy brothers in whose fighting a man trusts even if a great strife arise Would that with my present temper I were as young as thou  either the son of blameless Odysseus or Odysseus himself straightway then might some stranger cut my head from off my neck if I did not prove myself the bane of them all when I had come to the halls of Odysseus son of Laertes  But if they should overwhelm me by their numbers alone as I was far rather would I die slain in my own halls than behold continually these shameful deeds strangers mishandled and men dragging the handmaidens in shameful fashion through the fair halls  and wine drawn to waste and men devouring my bread all heedlessly without limit with no end to the business And wise Telemachus answered him Then verily stranger I will frankly tell thee all Neither do the people at large bear me any grudge or hatred  nor have I cause to blame brothers in whose fighting a man trusts even if a great strife arise For in this wise has the son of Cronos made our house to run in but a single line As his only son did Arceisius beget Laertes as his only son again did his father beget Odysseus and Odysseus  begot me as his only son and left me in his halls and had no joy of me Therefore it is that foes past counting are now in the house for all the princes who hold sway over the islands Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus and those who lord it over rocky Ithaca  all these woo my mother and lay waste my house And she neither refuses the hateful marriage nor is she able to make an end but they with feasting consume my substance and will ere long bring me too to ruin Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods  But father do thou go with speed and tell constant Penelope that she has me safe and I am come from Pylos But I will abide here and do thou come back hither when thou hast told thy tale to her alone but of the rest of the Achaeans let no one learn it for many there are who contrive evil against me  To him then swineherd Eumaeus didst thou make answer and say I see I give heed this thou biddest one with understanding But come now tell me this and declare it truly whether I shall go on the self-same way with tidings to Laertes also wretched man who for a time though grieving sorely for Odysseus  was still wont to oversee the fields and would eat and drink with the slaves in the house as the heart in his breast bade him But now from the day when thou wentest in thy ship to Pylos they say he has no more eaten and drunk as before nor overseen the fields but with groaning and wailing  he sits and weeps and the flesh wastes from off his bones Then wise Telemachus answered him 'Tis the sadder but none the less we will let him be despite our sorrow for if in any wise all things might be had by mortals for the wishing we should choose first of all the day of my father's return  No do thou come back when thou hast given thy message and wander not over the fields in search of Laertes but did my mother with all speed send forth her handmaid the housewife secretly for she might bear word to the old man With this he roused the swineherd and he took his sandals in his hands  and bound them beneath his feet and went forth to the city Nor was Athena unaware that the swineherd Eumaeus was gone from the farmstead but she drew near in the likeness of a woman comely and tall and skilled in glorious handiwork And she stood over against the door of the hut shewing herself to Odysseus  but Telemachus did not see her before him or notice her for in no wise do the gods appear in manifest presence to all But Odysseus saw her and the hounds and they barked not but with whining slunk in fear to the further side of the farmstead The she made a sign with her brows and goodly Odysseus perceived it  and went forth from the hall past the great wall of the court and stood before her and Athena spoke to him saying Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices even now do thou reveal thy word to thy son and hide it not that when you two have planned death and fate for the wooers  you may go to the famous city Nor will I myself be long away from you for I am eager for the battle With this Athena touched him with her golden wand A well-washed cloak and a tunic she first of all cast about his breast and she increased his stature and his youthful bloom  Once more he grew dark of color and his cheeks filled out and dark grew the beard about his chin Then when she had wrought thus she departed but Odysseus went into the hut And his dear son marvelled and seized with fear turned his eyes aside lest it should be a god  And he spoke and addressed him with winged words Of other sort thou seemest to me now stranger than awhile ago and other are the garments thou hast on and thy color is no more the same Verily thou art a god one of those who hold broad heaven Nay then be gracious that we may offer to thee acceptable sacrifices  and golden gifts finely wrought but do thou spare us Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered him Be sure I am no god why dost thou liken me to the immortals Nay I am thy father for whose sake thou dost with groaning endure many griefs and submittest to the violence of men  So saying he kissed his son and from his cheeks let fall a tear to earth but before he ever steadfastly held them back Howbeit Telemachus for he did not yet believe that it was his father again answered and spoke to him saying Thou verily art not my father Odysseus but some god  beguiles me that I may weep and groan yet more For nowise could a mortal man contrive this by his own wit unless a god were himself to come to him and easily by his will make him young or old For verily but now thou wast an old man and meanly clad  whereas now thou art like the gods who hold broad heaven Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said Telemachus it beseems thee not to wonder overmuch that thy father is in the house or to be amazed For thou mayest be sure no other Odysseus will ever come hither  but I here I even such as thou seest me after sufferings and many wanderings am come in the twentieth year to my native land But this thou must know is the work of Athena driver of the spoil who makes me such as she will for she has the power now like a beggar and now again  like a young man and one wearing fair raiment about his body Easy it is for the gods who hold broad heaven both to glorify a mortal man and to abase him So saying he sat down and Telemachus flinging his arms about his noble father wept and shed tears  and in the hearts of both arose a longing for lamentation And they wailed aloud more vehemently than birds sea-eagles or vultures with crooked talons whose young the country-folk have taken from their nest before they were fledged even so piteously did they let tears fall from beneath their brows  And now would the light of the sun have gone down upon their weeping had not Telemachus spoken to his father suddenly In what manner of ship dear father have sailors now brought thee hither to Ithaca Who did they declare themselves to be For nowise methinks didst thou come hither on foot  And the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered him Then verily my child I will tell thee all the truth The Phaeacians brought me men famed for their ships who send other men too on their way whosoever comes to them And they brought me as I slept in a swift ship over the sea  and set me down in Ithaca and gave me glorious gifts stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment These treasures by the favour of the gods are lying in caves And now I am come hither at the bidding of Athena that we may take counsel about the slaying of our foes  Come now count me the wooers and tell their tale that I may know how many they are and what manner of men and that I may ponder in my noble heart and decide whether we two shall be able to maintain our cause against them alone without others or whether we shall also seek out others  Then wise Telemachus answered him Father of a truth I have ever heard of thy great fame that thou wast a warrior in strength of hand and in wise counsel but this thou sayest is too great amazement holds me It could not be that two men should fight against many men and mighty  For of the wooers there are not ten alone or twice ten but full many more Here as we are shalt thou straightway learn their number From Dulichium there are two and fifty chosen youths and six serving men attend them from Same came four and twenty men  from Zacynthus there are twenty youths of the Achaeans and from Ithaca itself twelve men all of them the noblest and with them is Medon the herald and the divine minstrel and two squires skilled in carving meats If we shall meet all these within the halls  bitter I fear and with bane will be thy coming to avenge violence Nay do thou consider if thou canst bethink thee of any helper one that would aid us two with a ready heart Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered himWell then I will tell thee and do thou give heed and hearken to my words  and consider whether for us two Athena with father Zeus will be enough or whether I shall bethink me of some other helper Then wise Telemachus answered him Good thou mayest be sure are these two helpers whom thou dost mention though high in the clouds do they abide and they  rule over all men alike and the immortal gods Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered Not long of a surety will those two hold aloof from the mighty fray when between the wooers and us in my halls the might of Ares is put to the test  But for the present do thou go at daybreak to thy house and join the company of the haughty wooers As for me the swineherd will lead me later on to the city in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar And if they shall put despite on me in the house  let the heart in thy breast endure while I am evil entreated even if they drag me by the feet through the house to the door or hurl at me and smite me still do thou endure to behold it Thou shalt indeed bid them cease their folly seeking to dissuade them with gentle words yet in no wise  will they hearken to thee for verily their day of doom is at hand And another thing will I tell thee and do thou lay it to heart When Athena rich in counsel shall put it in my mind I will nod to thee with my head and do thou thereupon when thou notest it take all the weapons of war that lie in thy halls  and lay them away one and all in the secret place of the lofty store-room And as for the wooers when they miss the arms and question thee do thou beguile them with gentle words saying Out of the smoke have I laid them since they are no longer like those which of old Odysseus left behind him when he went forth to Troy  but are all befouled so far as the breath of the fire has reached them And furthermore this greater fear has the son of Cronos put in my heart lest haply when heated with wine you may set a quarrel afoot among you and wound one another and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing For of itself does the iron draw a man to it  But for us two alone do thou leave behind two swords and two spears and two ox-hide shields for us to grasp that we may rush upon them and seize them while as for the wooers Pallas Athena and Zeus the counsellor will beguile them And another thing will I tell thee and do thou lay it to heart  If in truth thou art my son and of our blood then let no one hear that Odysseus is at home neither let Laertes know it nor the swineherd nor any of the household nor Penelope herself but by ourselves thou and I will learn the temper of the women  Aye and we will likewise make trial of many a one of the serving men and see where any of them honours us two and fears us at heart and who recks not of us and scorns thee a man so goodly Then his glorious son answered him and said Father my spirit methinks  thou shalt verily come to know hereafter for no slackness of will possesses me But I think not that this plan will be a gain to us both and so I bid thee take thought Long time shalt thou vainly go about making trial of each man as thou visitest the farms while in thy halls those others at their ease  are wasting thy substance in insolent wise and there is no sparing Yet verily as for the women I do bid thee learn who among them dishonor thee and who are guiltless But of the men in the farmsteads I would not that we should make trial but that we should deal therewith hereafter  if in very truth thou knowest some sign from Zeus who bears the aegis Thus they spoke to one another but meanwhile into Ithaca put the well-built ship that brought Telemachus and all his comrades from Pylos and they when they had come into the deep harbor  drew the black ship up on the shore while proud squires bore forth their armour and straightway carried the beauteous gifts to the house of Clytius But they sent a herald forth to the house of Odysseus to bear word to wise Penelope  that Telemachus was at the farm and had bidden the ship to sail on to the city lest the noble queen might grow anxious and let round tears fall So the two met the herald and the goodly swineherd on the self-same errand to bear tidings to the lady  And when they reached the palace of the godlike king the herald spoke out in the midst of the handmaids and said Even now queen thy son has come back from Pylos But the swineherd came close to Penelope and told her all that her dear son had bidden him say  And when he had fully told all that had been commanded him he went his way to the swine and left the courtyard and the hall But the wooers were dismayed and downcast in spirit and forth they went from the hall past the great wall of the court and there before the gates they sat down  Then among them Eurymachus son of Polybus was the first to speak My friends verily a great deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus even this journey and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished But come let us launch a black ship the best we have and let us get together seamen as rowers that they may straightway  bear tidings to those others speedily to return home Not yet was the word fully uttered when Amphinomus turning in his place saw a ship in the deep harbor and men furling the sail and with oars in their hands Then breaking into a merry laugh he spoke among his comrades  Let us not be sending a message any more for here they are at home Either some god told them of this or they themselves caught sight of the ship of Telemachus as she sailed by but could not catch her So he spoke and they rose up and went to the shore of the sea Swiftly the men drew up the black ship on the shore  and proud squires bore forth their armour Themselves meanwhile went all together to the place of assembly and none other would they suffer to sit with them either of the young men or the old Then among them spoke Antinous son of Eupeithes Lo now see how the gods have delivered this man from destruction  Day by day watchmen sat upon the windy heights watch ever following watch and at set of sun we never spent a night upon the shore but sailing over the deep in our swift ship we waited for the bright Dawn lying in wait for Telemachus that we might take him and slay  the man himself howbeit meanwhile some god has brought him home But on our part let us here devise for him a woeful death even for Telemachus and let him not escape from out our hands for I deem that while he lives this work of ours will not prosper For he is himself shrewd in counsel and in wisdom  and the people nowise show us favour any more Nay come before he gathers the Achaeans to the place of assembly for methinks he will in no wise be slow to act but will be full of wrath and rising up will declare among them all how that we contrived against him utter destruction but did not catch him  and they will not praise us when they hear of our evil deeds Beware then lest they work us some harm and drive us out from our country and we come to the land of strangers Nay let us act first and seize him in the field far from the city or on the road and his substance let us ourselves keep and his wealth  dividing them fairly among us though the house we would give to his mother to possess and to him who weds her Howbeit if this plan does not please you but you choose rather that he should live and keep all the wealth of his fathers let us not continue to devour his store of pleasant things  as we gather together here but let each man from his own hall woo her with his gifts and seek to win her and she then would wed him who offers most and who comes as her fated lord So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence Then Amphinomus addressed their assembly and spoke among them  He was the glorious son of the prince Nisus son of Aretias and he led the wooers who came from Dulichium rich in wheat and in grass and above all the others he pleased Penelope with his words for he had an understanding heart He it was who with good intent addressed their assembly and spoke among them  Friends I surely would not choose to kill Telemachus a dread thing is it to slay one of royal stock Nay let us first seek to learn the will of the gods If the oracles of great Zeus approve I will myself slay him and bid all the others do so  but if the gods turn us from the act I bid you desist Thus spoke Amphinomus and his word was pleasing to them So they arose straightway and went to the house of Odysseus and entering in sat down on the polished seats Then the wise Penelope took other counsel  to show herself to the wooers overweening in their insolence For she had learned of the threatened death of her son in her halls for the herald Medon told her who had heard their counsel So she went her way toward the hall with her handmaids But when the fair lady reached the wooers  she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall holding before her face her shining veil and she rebuked Antinous and spoke and addressed him Antinous full of insolence deviser of evil and yet it is thou men say that dost excel among all of thy years in the land of Ithaca  in counsel and in speech But thou it seems art not such a man Madman why dost thou devise death and fate for Telemachus and carest not for suppliants for whom Zeus is witness 'Tis an impious thing to plot evil one against another Dost thou not know of the time when thy father came to this house a fugitive  in terror of the people For of a truth they were greatly wroth with him because he had joined Taphian pirates and harried the Thesprotians who were in league with us Him then they were minded to slay and take from him his life by violence and utterly to devour his great and pleasant livelihood  but Odysseus held them back and stayed them despite their eagerness His house it is that thou consumest now without atonement and wooest his wife and seekest to slay his son and on me thou bringest great distress Nay forbear I charge thee and bid the rest forbear Then Eurymachus son of Polybus answered her  Daughter of Icarius wise Penelope be of good cheer and let not things distress thy heart That man lives not nor shall live nor shall ever be born who shall lay hands upon thy son Telemachus while I live and behold the light upon the earth  For thus will I speak out to thee and verily it shall be brought to pass Quickly shall that man's black blood flow forth about my spear for of a truth me too did Odysseus the sacker of cities often set upon his knees and put roast meat in my hands and hold to my lips red wine  Therefore Telemachus is far the dearest of all men to me and I bid him have no fear of death at least from the wooers but from the gods can no man avoid it Thus he spoke to cheer her but against that son he was himself plotting death So she went up to her bright upper chamber  and then bewailed Odysseus her dear husband until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids But at evening the goodly swineherd came back to Odysseus and his son and they were busily making ready their supper and had slain a boar of a year old Then Athena  came close to Odysseus son of Laertes and smote him with her wand and again made him an old man and mean raiment she put about his body lest the swineherd might look upon him and know him and might go to bear tidings to constant Penelope and not hold the secret fast in his heart  Now Telemachus spoke first to the swineherd and said Thou hast come goodly Eumaeus What news is there in the city Have the proud wooers by this time come home from their ambush or are they still watching for me where they were to take me on my homeward way To him then swineherd Eumaeus didst thou make answer and say  I was not minded to go about the city asking and enquiring of this my heart bade me with all speed to come back hither when I had given my message But there joined me a swift messenger from thy companions a herald who was the first to tell the news to thy mother  And this further thing I know for I saw it with my eyes I was now above the city as I went on my way where the hill of Hermes is when I saw a swift ship putting into our harbor and there were many men in her and she was laden with shields and double-pointed spears  And I thought it was they but I have no knowledge So he spoke and the strong and mighty Telemachus smiled and with his eyes he glanced at his father but shunned the swineherd's eye And when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal they fell to feasting nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast  But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink they bethought them of rest and took the gift of sleep
