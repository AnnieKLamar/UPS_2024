 Now Dawn arose from her couch from beside lordly Tithonus to bear light to the immortals and to mortal men And the gods were sitting down to council and among them Zeus who thunders on high whose might is supreme  To them Athena was recounting the many woes of Odysseus as she called them to mind for it troubled her that he abode in the dwelling of the nymph Father Zeus and ye other blessed gods that are forever never henceforward let sceptred king with a ready heart be kind and gentle nor let him heed righteousness in his mind  but let him ever be harsh and work unrighteousness seeing that no one remembers divine Odysseus of the people whose lord he was yet gentle was he as a father He verily abides in an island suffering grievous pains in the halls of the nymph Calypso who  keeps him perforce and he cannot return to his own land for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea And now again they are minded to slay his well-loved son on his homeward way for he went in quest of tidings of his father  to sacred Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon Then Zeus the cloud-gatherer answered her and said My child what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth Didst thou not thyself devise this plan that verily Odysseus might take vengeance on these men at his coming  But concerning Telemachus do thou guide him in thy wisdom for thou canst that all unscathed he may reach his native land and the wooers may come back in their ship baffled in their purpose He spoke and said to Hermes his dear sonHermes do thou now seeing that thou art at other times our messenger  declare to the fair-tressed nymph our fixed resolve even the return of Odysseus of the steadfast heart that he may return with guidance neither of gods nor of mortal men but that on a stoutly-bound raft suffering woes he may come on the twentieth day to deep-soiled Scheria  the land of the Phaeacians who are near of kin to the gods These shall heartily shew him all honor as if he were a god and shall send him in a ship to his dear native land after giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from Troy  if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil For in this wise it is his fate to see his friends and reach his high-roofed house and his native land So he spoke and the messenger Argeiphontes failed not to hearken Straightway he bound beneath his feet his beautiful sandals  immortal golden which were wont to bear him over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind And he took the wand wherewith he lulls to sleep the eyes of whom he will while others again he awakens even out of slumber With this in his hand the strong Argeiphontes flew  On to Pieria he stepped from the upper air and swooped down upon the sea and then sped over the wave like a bird the cormorant which in quest of fish over the dread gulfs of the unresting sea wets its thick plumage in the brine In such wise did Hermes ride upon the multitudinous waves  But when he had reached the island which lay afar then forth from the violet sea he came to land and went his way until he came to a great cave wherein dwelt the fair-tressed nymph and he found her within A great fire was burning on the hearth and from afar over the isle there was a fragrance  of cleft cedar and juniper as they burned but she within was singing with a sweet voice as she went to and fro before the loom weaving with a golden shuttle Round about the cave grew a luxuriant wood alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress  wherein birds long of wing were wont to nest owls and falcons and sea-crows with chattering tongues who ply their business on the sea And right there about the hollow cave ran trailing a garden vine in pride of its prime richly laden with clusters  And fountains four in a row were flowing with bright water hard by one another turned one this way one that And round about soft meadows of violets and parsley were blooming There even an immortal who chanced to come might gaze and marvel and delight his soul  and there the messenger Argeiphontes stood and marvelled But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things straightway he went into the wide cave nor did Calypso the beautiful goddess fail to know him when she saw him face to face for not unknown are  the immortal gods to one another even though one dwells in a home far away But the great-hearted Odysseus he found not within for he sat weeping on the shore as his wont had been racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs and he would look over the unresting sea shedding tears  And Calypso the beautiful goddess questioned Hermes when she had made him sit on a bright shining chair Why pray Hermes of the golden wand hast thou come an honorable guest and welcome heretofore thou hast not been wont to come Speak what is in thy mind my heart bids me fulfil it  if fulfil it I can and it is a thing that hath fulfillment But follow me further that I may set before thee entertainment So saying the goddess set before him a table laden with ambrosia and mixed the ruddy nectar So he drank and ate the messenger Argeiphontes  But when he had dined and satisfied his soul with food then he made answer and addressed her saying Thou a goddess dost question me a god upon my coming and I will speak my word truly since thou biddest me It was Zeus who bade me come hither against my will  Who of his own will would speed over so great space of salt sea-water great past telling Nor is there at hand any city of mortals who offer to the gods sacrifice and choice hecatombs But it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus who bears the aegis  He says that there is here with thee a man most wretched above all those warriors who around the city of Priam fought for nine years and in the tenth year sacked the city and departed homeward But on the way they sinned against Athena and she sent upon them an evil wind and long waves  There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished but as for him the wind and the wave as they bore him brought him hither Him now Zeus bids thee to send on his way with all speed for it is not his fate to perish here far from his friends but it is still his lot to see his friends and reach  his high-roofed house and his native land So he spoke and Calypso the beautiful goddess shuddered and she spoke and addressed him with winged words Cruel are ye O ye gods and quick to envy above all others seeing that ye begrudge goddesses that they should mate with men  openly if any takes a mortal as her dear bed-fellow Thus when rosy-fingered Dawn took to herself Orion ye gods that live at ease begrudged her till in Ortygia chaste Artemis of the golden throne assailed him with her gentle shafts and slew him  Thus too when fair-tressed Demeter yielding to her passion lay in love with Iasion in the thrice-ploughed fallow land Zeus was not long without knowledge thereof but smote him with his bright thunder-bolt and slew him And even so again do ye now begrudge me O ye gods that a mortal man should abide with me  Him I saved when he was bestriding the keel and all alone for Zeus had smitten his swift ship with his bright thunder-bolt and had shattered it in the midst of the wine-dark sea There all the rest of his goodly comrades perished but as for him the wind and the wave as they bore him brought him hither  Him I welcomed kindly and gave him food and said that I would make him immortal and ageless all his days But since it is in no wise possible for any other god to evade or make void the will of Zeus who bears the aegis let him go his way if Zeus thus orders and commands  over the unresting sea But it is not I that shall give him convoy for I have at hand no ships with oars and no men to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea But with a ready heart will I give him counsel and will hide naught that all unscathed he may return to his native land  Then again the messenger Argeiphontes answered her Even so send him forth now and beware of the wrath of Zeus lest haply he wax wroth and visit his anger upon thee hereafter So saying the strong Argeiphontes departed and the queenly nymph went to the great-hearted Odysseus  when she had heard the message of Zeus Him she found sitting on the shore and his eyes were never dry of tears and his sweet life was ebbing away as he longed mournfully for his return for the nymph was no longer pleasing in his sight By night indeed he would sleep by her side perforce  in the hollow caves unwilling beside the willing nymph but by day he would sit on the rocks and the sands racking his soul with tears and groans and griefs and he would look over the unresting sea shedding tears Then coming close to him the beautiful goddess addressed him  Unhappy man sorrow no longer here I pray thee nor let thy life pine away for even now with a ready heart will I send thee on thy way Nay come hew with the axe long beams and make a broad raft and fasten upon it cross-planks for a deck well above it that it may bear thee over the misty deep  And I will place therein bread and water and red wine to satisfy thy heart to keep hunger from thee And I will clothe thee with raiment and will send a fair wind behind thee that all unscathed thou mayest return to thy native land if it be the will of the gods who hold broad heaven  for they are mightier than I both to purpose and to fulfil So she spoke and much-enduring goodly Odysseus shuddered and he spoke and addressed her with winged words Some other thing goddess art thou planning in this and not my sending seeing that thou biddest me cross on a raft the great gulf of the sea  dread and grievous over which not even the shapely swift-faring ships pass rejoicing in the wind of Zeus But I will not set foot on a raft in thy despite unless thou goddess wilt bring thyself to swear a mighty oath that thou wilt not plot against me any fresh mischief to my hurt  So he spoke but Calypso the beautiful goddess smiled and stroked him with her hand and spoke and addressed him Verily thou art a knave and not stunted in wit that thou hast bethought thee to utter such a word Now therefore let earth be witness to this and the broad heaven above  and the down-flowing water of the Styx which is the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods that I will not plot against thee any fresh mischief to thy hurt Nay I have such thoughts in mind and will give such counsel as I should devise for mine own self if such need should come on me  For I too have a mind that is righteous and the heart in this breast of mine is not of iron but hath compassion So saying the beautiful goddess led the way quickly and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess And they came to the hollow cave the goddess and the man  and he sat down upon the chair from which Hermes had arisen and the nymph set before him all manner of food to eat and drink of such sort as mortal men eat But she herself sat over against divine Odysseus and before her the handmaids set ambrosia and nectar  So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them But when they had their fill of food and drink Calypso the beautiful goddess was the first to speak and said Son of Laertes sprung from Zeus Odysseus of many devices  would'st thou then fare now forthwith home to thy dear native land Yet even so fare thee well Howbeit if in thy heart thou knewest all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil before thou comest to thy native land thou wouldest abide here and keep this house with me and wouldest be immortal for all thy desire to see  thy wife for whom thou longest day by day Surely not inferior to her do I declare myself to be either in form or stature for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should vie with immortals in form or comeliness Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her and said  Mighty goddess be not wroth with me for this I know full well of myself that wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou in comeliness and in stature for she is a mortal while thou art immortal and ageless But even so I wish and long day by day  to reach my home and to see the day of my return And if again some god shall smite me on the wine-dark sea I will endure it having in my breast a heart that endures affliction For ere this I have suffered much and toiled much amid the waves and in war let this also be added unto that  So he spoke and the sun set and darkness came on And the two went into the innermost recess of the hollow cave and took their joy of love abiding each by the other's side As soon as early Dawn appeared the rosy-fingered straightway Odysseus put on a cloak and a tunic  and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe finely woven and beautiful and about her waist she cast a fair girdle of gold and on her head a veil above Then she set herself to plan the sending of the great-hearted Odysseus She gave him a great axe well fitted to his hands  an axe of bronze sharpened on both sides and in it was a beautiful handle of olive wood securely fastened and thereafter she gave him a polished adze Then she led the way to the borders of the island where tall trees were standing alder and popular and fir reaching to the skies  long dry and well-seasoned which would float for him lightly But when she had shewn him where the tall trees grew Calypso the beautiful goddess returned homewards but he fell to cutting timbers and his work went forward apace Twenty trees in all did he fell and trimmed them with the axe  then he cunningly smoothed them all and made them straight to the line Meanwhile Calypso the beautiful goddess brought him augers and he bored all the pieces and fitted them to one another and with pegs and morticings did he hammer it together Wide as a man well-skilled in carpentry marks out the curve of the hull of a freight-ship  broad of beam even so wide did Odysseus make his raft And he set up the deck-beams bolting them to the close-set ribs and laboured on and he finished the raft with long gunwales In it he set a mast and a yard-arm fitted to it  and furthermore made him a steering-oar wherewith to steer Then he fenced in the whole from stem to stern with willow withes to be a defence against the wave and strewed much brush thereon Meanwhile Calypso the beautiful goddess brought him cloth to make him a sail and he fashioned that too with skill  And he made fast in the raft braces and halyards and sheets and then with levers forced it down into the bright sea Now the fourth day came and all his work was done And on the fifth the beautiful Calypso sent him on his way from the island after she had bathed him and clothed him in fragrant raiment  On the raft the goddess put a skin of dark wine and another a great one of water and provisions too in a wallet Therein she put abundance of dainties to satisfy his heart and she sent forth a gentle wind and warm Gladly then did goodly Odysseus spread his sail to the breeze  and he sat and guided his raft skilfully with the steering-oar nor did sleep fall upon his eyelids as he watched the Pleiads and late-setting Bootes and the Bear which men also call the Wain which ever circles where it is and watches Orion  and alone has no part in the baths of Ocean For this star Calypso the beautiful goddess had bidden him to keep on the left hand as he sailed over the sea For seventeen days then he sailed over the sea and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains  of the land of the Phaeacians where it lay nearest to him and it shewed like unto a shield in the misty deep But the glorious Earth-shaker as he came back from the Ethiopians beheld him from afar from the mountains of the Solymi for Odysseus was seen of him sailing over the sea and he waxed the more wroth in spirit  and shook his head and thus he spoke to his own heart Out on it Surely the gods have changed their purpose regarding Odysseus while I was among the Ethiopians And lo he is near to the land of the Phaeacians where it is his fate to escape from the great bonds of the woe which has come upon him  Aye but even yet methinks I shall drive him to surfeit of evil So saying he gathered the clouds and seizing his trident in his hands troubled the sea and roused all blasts of all manner of winds and hid with clouds land and sea alike and night rushed down from heaven  Together the East Wind and the South Wind dashed and the fierce-blowing West Wind and the North Wind born in the bright heaven rolling before him a mighty wave Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and his heart melted and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit Ah me wretched that I am What is to befall me at the last  I fear me that verily all that the goddess said was true when she declared that on the sea before ever I came to my native land I should fill up my measure of woes and lo all this now is being brought to pass In such wise does Zeus overcast the broad heaven with clouds and has stirred up the sea and the blasts  of all manner of winds sweep upon me now is my utter destruction sure Thrice blessed those Danaans aye four times blessed who of old perished in the wide land of Troy doing the pleasure of the sons of Atreus Even so would that I had died and met my fate on that day when the throngs  of the Trojans hurled upon me bronze-tipped spears fighting around the body of the dead son of Peleus Then should I have got funeral rites and the Achaeans would have spread my fame but now by a miserable death was it appointed me to be cut off Even as thus he spoke the great wave smote him from on high rushing upon him with terrible might and around it whirled his raft  Far from the raft he fell and let fall the steering-oar from his hand but his mast was broken in the midst by the fierce blast of tumultuous winds that came upon it and far in the sea sail and yardarm fell As for him long time did the wave hold him in the depths nor could he  rise at once from beneath the onrush of the mighty wave for the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him weighed him down At length however he came up and spat forth from his mouth the bitter brine which flowed in streams from his head Yet even so he did not forget his raft in evil case though he was  but sprang after it amid the waves and laid hold of it and sat down in the midst of it seeking to escape the doom of death and a great wave ever bore him this way and that along its course As when in autumn the North Wind bears the thistle-tufts over the plain and close they cling to one another  so did the winds bear the raft this way and that over the sea Now the South Wind would fling it to the North Wind to be driven on and now again the East Wind would yield it to the West Wind to drive But the daughter of Cadmus Ino of the fair ankles saw him even Leucothea who of old was a mortal of human speech  but now in the deeps of the sea has won a share of honor from the gods She was touched with pity for Odysseus as he wandered and was in sore travail and she rose up from the deep like a sea-mew on the wing and sat on the stoutly-bound raft and spoke saying Unhappy man how is it that Poseidon the earth-shaker  has conceived such furious wrath against thee that he is sowing for thee the seeds of many evils Yet verily he shall not utterly destroy thee for all his rage Nay do thou thus and methinks thou dost not lack understanding Strip off these garments and leave thy raft to be driven by the winds but do thou swim with thy hands and so strive to reach  the land of the Phaeacians where it is thy fate to escape Come take this veil and stretch it beneath thy breast It is immortal there is no fear that thou shalt suffer aught or perish But when with thy hands thou hast laid hold of the land loose it from thee and cast it into the wine-dark sea  far from the land and thyself turn away So saying the goddess gave him the veil and herself plunged again into the surging deep like a sea-mew and the dark wave hid her Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus pondered  and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit Woe is me Let it not be that some one of the immortals is again weaving a snare for me that she bids me leave my raft Nay but verily I will not yet obey for afar off mine eyes beheld the land where she said I was to escape  But this will I do and meseems that this is best as long as the timbers hold firm in their fastenings so long will I remain here and endure to suffer affliction but when the wave shall have shattered the raft to pieces I will swim seeing that there is naught better to devise  While he pondered thus in mind and heart Poseidon the earth-shaker made to rise up a great wave dread and grievous arching over from above and drove it upon him And as when a strong wind tosses a heap of straw that is dry and some it scatters here some there  even so the wave scattered the long timbers of the raft But Odysseus bestrode one plank as though he were riding a horse and stripped off the garments which beautiful Calypso had given him Then straightway he stretched the veil beneath his breast and flung himself headlong into the sea with hands outstretched  ready to swim And the lord the earth-shaker saw him and he shook his head and thus he spoke to his own heart So now after thou hast suffered many ills go wandering over the deep till thou comest among the folk fostered of Zeus Yet even so methinks thou shalt not make any mock at thy suffering  So saying he lashed his fair-maned horses and came to Aegae where is his glorious palace But Athena daughter of Zeus took other counsel She stayed the paths of the other winds and bade them all cease and be lulled to rest  but she roused the swift North Wind and broke the waves before him to the end that Zeus-born Odysseus might come among the Phaeacians lovers of the oar escaping from death and the fates Then for two nights and two days he was driven about over the swollen waves and full often his heart forboded destruction  But when fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day then the wind ceased and there was a windless calm and he caught sight of the shore close at hand casting a quick glance forward as he was raised up by a great wave And even as when most welcome to his children appears the life  of a father who lies in sickness bearing grievous pains long while wasting away and some cruel god assails him but then to their joy the gods free him from his woe so to Odysseus did the land and the wood seem welcome and he swam on eager to set foot on the land  But when he was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs for the great wave thundered against the dry land belching upon it in terrible fashion and all things were wrapped in the foam of the sea for there were neither harbors where ships might ride nor road-steads  but projecting headlands and reefs and cliffs then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit Ah me when Zeus has at length granted me to see the land beyond my hopes and lo I have prevailed to cleave my way and to cross this gulf  nowhere doth there appear a way to come forth from the grey sea For without are sharp crags and around them the wave roars foaming and the rock runs up sheer and the water is deep close in shore so that in no wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape ruin  Haply were I to seek to land a great wave may seize me and dash me against the jagged rock and so shall my striving be in vain But if I swim on yet further in hope to find shelving beaches and harbors of the sea I fear me lest the storm-wind may catch me up again  and bear me groaning heavily over the teeming deep or lest some god may even send forth upon me some great monster from out the sea and many such does glorious Amphitrite breed For I know that the glorious Earth-shaker is filled with wrath against me While he pondered thus in mind and heart  a great wave bore him against the rugged shore There would his skin have been stripped off and his bones broken had not the goddess flashing-eyed Athena put a thought in his mind On he rushed and seized the rock with both hands and clung to it groaning until the great wave went by  Thus then did he escape this wave but in its backward flow it once more rushed upon him and smote him and flung him far out in the sea And just as when a cuttlefish is dragged from its hole many pebbles cling to its suckers even so from his strong hands  were bits of skin stripped off against the rocks and the great wave covered him Then verily would hapless Odysseus have perished beyond his fate had not flashing-eyed Athena given him prudence Making his way forth from the surge where it belched upon the shore he swam outside looking ever toward the land in hope to find  shelving beaches and harbors of the sea But when as he swam he came to the mouth of a fair-flowing river where seemed to him the best place since it was smooth of stones and besides there was shelter from the wind he knew the river as he flowed forth and prayed to him in his heart  Hear me O king whosoever thou art As to one greatly longed-for do I come to thee seeking to escape from out the sea from the threats of Poseidon Reverend even in the eyes of the immortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer even as I have now come to thy stream and to thy knees after many toils  Nay pity me O king for I declare that I am thy suppliant So he spoke and the god straightway stayed his stream and checked the waves and made a calm before him and brought him safely to the mouth of the river And he let his two knees bend and his strong hands fall for his spirit was crushed by the sea  And all his flesh was swollen and sea water flowed in streams up through his mouth and nostrils So he lay breathless and speechless with scarce strength to move for terrible weariness had come upon him But when he revived and his spirit returned again into his breast then he loosed from him the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river that murmured seaward  and the great wave bore it back down the stream and straightway Ino received it in her hands But Odysseus going back from the river sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth the giver of grain and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit  Ah woe is me what is to befall me What will happen to me at the last If here in the river bed I keep watch throughout the weary night I fear that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may overcome me when from feebleness I have breathed forth my spirit and the breeze from the river blows cold in the early morning  But if I climb up the slope to the shady wood and lie down to rest in the thick brushwood in the hope that the cold and weariness might leave me and if sweet sleep comes over me I fear me lest I become a prey and spoil to wild beasts Then as he pondered this thing seemed to him the better  he went his way to the wood and found it near the water in a clear space and he crept beneath two bushes that grew from the same spot one of thorn and one of olive Through these the strength of the wet winds could never blow nor the rays of the bright sun beat  nor could the rain pierce through them so closely did they grow intertwining one with the other Beneath these Odysseus crept and straightway gathered with his hands a broad bed for fallen leaves were there in plenty enough to shelter two men or three  in winter-time however bitter the weather And the much-enduring goodly Odysseus saw it and was glad and he lay down in the midst and heaped over him the fallen leaves And as a man hides a brand beneath the dark embers in an outlying farm a man who has no neighbors  and so saves a seed of fire that he may not have to kindle it from some other source so Odysseus covered himself with leaves And Athena shed sleep upon his eyes that it might enfold his lids and speedily free him from toilsome weariness
