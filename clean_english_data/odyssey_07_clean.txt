 So he prayed there the much-enduring goodly Odysseus while the two strong mules bore the maiden to the city But when she had come to the glorious palace of her father she halted the mules at the outer gate and her brothers  thronged about her men like the immortals and loosed the mules from the wagon and bore the raiment within and she herself went to her chamber There a fire was kindled for her by her waiting-woman Eurymedusa an aged dame from Apeire Long ago the curved ships had brought her from Apeire  and men had chosen her from the spoil as a gift of honor for Alcinous for that he was king over all the Phaeacians and the people hearkened to him as to a god She it was who had reared the white-armed Nausicaa in the palace and she it was who kindled the fire for her and made ready her supper in the chamber Then Odysseus roused himself to go to the city and Athena  with kindly purpose cast about him a thick mist that no one of the great-hearted Phaeacians meeting him should speak mockingly to him and ask him who he was But when he was about to enter the lovely city then the goddess flashing-eyed Athena met him  in the guise of a young maiden carrying a pitcher and she stood before him and goodly Odysseus questioned her saying My child couldst thou not guide me to the house of him they call Alcinous who is lord among the people here For I am come hither a stranger sore-tried  from afar from a distant country wherefore I know no one of the people who possess this city and land Then the goddess flashing-eyed Athena answered him Then verily Sir stranger I will shew thee the palace as thou dost bid me for it lies hard by the house of my own noble father  Only go thou quietly and I will lead the way But turn not thine eyes upon any man nor question any for the men here endure not stranger-folk nor do they give kindly welcome to him who comes from another land They indeed trusting in the speed of their swift ships  cross over the great gulf of the sea for this the Earth-shaker has granted them and their ships are swift as a bird on the wing or as a thought So speaking Pallas Athena led the way quickly and he followed in the footsteps of the goddess  And as he went through the city in the midst of them the Phaeacians famed for their ships took no heed of him for fair-tressed Athena the dread goddess would not suffer it but shed about him a wondrous mist for her heart was kind toward him And Odysseus marvelled at the harbors and the stately ships at the meeting-places where the heroes themselves gathered and the walls long and  high and crowned with palisades a wonder to behold But when they had come to the glorious palace of the king the goddess flashing-eyed Athena was the first to speak saying Here Sir stranger is the house which thou didst bid me shew to thee and thou wilt find the kings fostered of Zeus  feasting at the banquet Go thou within and let thy heart fear nothing for a bold man is better in all things though he be a stranger from another land The queen shalt thou approach first in the palace Arete is the name by which she is called  and she is sprung from the same line as is the king Alcinous Nausithous at the first was born from the earth-shaker Poseidon and Periboea the comeliest of women youngest daughter of great-hearted Eurymedon who once was king over the insolent Giants  But he brought destruction on his froward people and was himself destroyed But with Periboea lay Poseidon and begat a son great-hearted Nausithous who ruled over the Phaeacians and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and Alcinous Rhexenor when as yet he had no son Apollo of the silver bow smote  in his hall a bridegroom though he was and he left only one daughter Arete Her Alcinous made his wife and honored her as no other woman on earth is honored of all those who in these days direct their households in subjection to their husbands so heartily is she honored  and has ever been by her children and by Alcinous himself and by the people who look upon her as upon a goddess and greet her as she goes through the city For she of herself is no wise lacking in good understanding and for the women to whom she has good will she makes an end of strife even among their husbands  If in her sight thou dost win favour then there is hope that thou wilt see thy friends and return to thy high-roofed house and unto thy native land So saying flashing-eyed Athena departed over the unresting sea and left lovely Scheria  She came to Marathon and broad-wayed Athens and entered the well-built house of Erectheus but Odysseus went to the glorious palace of Alcinous There he stood and his heart pondered much before he reached the threshold of bronze for there was a gleam as of sun or moon  over the high-roofed house of great-hearted Alcinous Of bronze were the walls that stretched this way and that from the threshold to the innermost chamber and around was a cornice of cyanus Golden were the doors that shut in the well-built house and doorposts of silver were set in a threshold of bronze  Of silver was the lintel above and of gold the handle On either side of the door there stood gold and silver dogs which Hephaestus had fashioned with cunning skill to guard the palace of great-hearted Alcinous immortal were they and ageless all their days  Within seats were fixed along the wall on either hand from the threshold to the innermost chamber and on them were thrown robes of soft fabric cunningly woven the handiwork of women On these the leaders of the Phaeacians were wont to sit drinking and eating for they had unfailing store  And golden youths stood on well-built pedestals holding lighted torches in their hands to give light by night to the banqueters in the hall And fifty slave-women he had in the house of whom some grind the yellow grain on the millstone  and others weave webs or as they sit twirl the yarn like unto the leaves of a tall poplar tree and from the closely-woven linen the soft olive oil drips downFor as the Phaeacian men are skilled above all others in speeding a swift ship upon the sea so are the women  cunning workers at the loom for Athena has given to them above all others skill in fair handiwork and an understanding heart But without the courtyard hard by the door is a great orchard of four acres and a hedge runs about it on either side Therein grow trees tall and luxuriant  pears and pomegranates and apple-trees with their bright fruit and sweet figs and luxuriant olives Of these the fruit perishes not nor fails in winter or in summer but lasts throughout the year and ever does the west wind as it blows quicken to life some fruits and ripen others  pear upon pear waxes ripe apple upon apple cluster upon cluster and fig upon fig There too is his fruitful vineyard planted one part of which a warm spot on level ground is being dried in the sun while other grapes men are gathering  and others too they are treading but in front are unripe grapes that are shedding the blossom and others that are turning purple There again by the last row of the vines grow trim garden beds of every sort blooming the year through and therein are two springs one of which sends its water throughout all the garden  while the other over against it flows beneath the threshold of the court toward the high house from this the townsfolk drew their water Such were the glorious gifts of the gods in the palace of Alcinous There the much-enduring goodly Odysseus stood and gazed But when he had marvelled in his heart at all things  he passed quickly over the threshold into the house There he found the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians pouring libations from their cups to the keen-sighted Argeiphontes to whom they were wont to pour the wine last of all when they were minded to go to their rest But the much-enduring goodly Odysseus went through the hall  wrapped in the thick mist which Athena had shed about him till he came to Arete and to Alcinous the king About the knees of Arete Odysseus cast his hands and straightway the wondrous mist melted from him and a hush fell upon all that were in the room at sight of the man  and they marvelled as they looked upon him But Odysseus made his prayer Arete daughter of godlike Rhexenor to thy husband and to thy knees am I come after many toils aye and to these banqueters to whom may the gods grant happiness in life and may each of them hand down to his children  the wealth in his halls and the dues of honor which the people have given him But for me do ye speed my sending that I may come to my native land and that quickly for long time have I been suffering woes far from my friends So saying he sat down on the hearth in the ashes by the fire and they were all hushed in silence  But at length there spoke among them the old lord Echeneus who was an elder among the Phaeacians well skilled in speech and understanding all the wisdom of old He with good intent addressed the assembly and said Alcinous lo this is not the better way nor is it seemly  that a stranger should sit upon the ground on the hearth in the ashes but these others hold back waiting for thy word Come make the stranger to arise and set him upon a silver-studded chair and bid the heralds mix wine  that we may pour libations also to Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants And let the housewife give supper to the stranger of the store that is in the house When the strong and mighty Alcinous heard this he took by the hand Odysseus the wise and crafty-minded and raised him from the hearth and set him upon a bright chair  from which he bade his son the kindly Laodamas to rise for he sat next to him and was his best beloved Then a handmaid brought water for the hands in a fair pitcher of gold and poured it over a silver basin for him to wash and beside him drew up a polished table  And the grave housewife brought and set before him bread and therewith dainties in abundance giving freely of her store So the much-enduring goodly Odysseus drank and ate and then the mighty Alcinous spoke to the herald and said Pontonous mix the bowl and serve wine  to all in the hall that we may pour libations also to Zeus who hurls the thunderbolt for he ever attends upon reverend suppliants He spoke and Pontonous mixed the honey-hearted wine and served out to all pouring first drops for libation into the cups But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart's content  Alcinous addressed the assembly and spoke among them Hearken to me leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me Now that ye have finished your feast go each of you to his house to rest But in the morning we will call more of the elders together  and will entertain the stranger in our halls and offer goodly victims to the gods After that we will take thought also of his sending that without toil or pain yon stranger may under our sending come to his native land speedily and with rejoicing though he come from never so far  Nor shall he meanwhile suffer any evil or harm until he sets foot upon his own land but thereafter he shall suffer whatever Fate and the dread Spinners spun with their thread for him at his birth when his mother bore himBut if he is one of the immortals come down from heaven  then is this some new thing which the gods are planning for ever heretofore have they been wont to appear to us in manifest form when we sacrifice to them glorious hecatombs and they feast among us sitting even where we sit Aye and if one of us as a lone wayfarer meets them  they use no concealment for we are of near kin to them as are the Cyclopes and the wild tribes of the Giants Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said Alcinous far from thee be that thought for I am not like the immortals who hold broad heaven  either in stature or in form but like mortal men Whomsoever ye know among men who bear greatest burden of woe to them might I liken myself in my sorrows Yea and I could tell a yet longer tale of all the evils which I have endured by the will of the gods  But as for me suffer me now to eat despite my grief for there is nothing more shameless than a hateful belly which bids a man perforce take thought thereof be he never so sore distressed and laden with grief at heart even as I too am laden with grief at heart yet ever does my belly  bid me eat and drink and makes me forget all that I have suffered and commands me to eat my fill But do ye make haste at break of day that ye may set me hapless one on the soil of my native land even after my many woes Yea let life leave me when I have seen once more  my possessions my slaves and my great high-roofed house So he spoke and they all praised his words and bade send the stranger on his way since he had spoken fittingly Then when they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart's content they went each man to his home to take their rest  and goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall and beside him sat Arete and godlike Alcinous and the handmaids cleared away the dishes of the feast Then white-armed Arete was the first to speak for as she saw it she knew his  fair raiment the mantle and tunic which she herself had wrought with her handmaids And she spoke and addressed him with winged words Stranger this question will I myself ask thee first Who art thou among men and from whence Who gave thee this raiment Didst thou not say that thou camest hither wandering over the sea  Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her and said Hard were it O queen to tell to the end the tale of my woes since full many have the heavenly gods given me But this will I tell thee of which thou dost ask and enquire There is an isle Ogygia which lies far off in the sea  Therein dwells the fair-tressed daughter of Atlas guileful Calypso a dread goddess and with her no one either of gods or mortals hath aught to do but me in my wretchedness did fate bring to her hearth alone for Zeus had smitten my swift ship with his bright thunderbolt  and had shattered it in the midst of the wine-dark sea There all the rest of my trusty comrades perished but I clasped in my arms the keel of my curved ship and was borne drifting for nine days and on the tenth black night the gods brought me to the isle Ogygia where  the fair-tressed Calypso dwells a dread goddess She took me to her home with kindly welcome and gave me food and said that she would make me immortal and ageless all my days but she could never persuade the heart in my breast There for seven years' space I remained continually and ever  with my tears would I wet the immortal raiment which Calypso gave me But when the eight year came in circling course then she roused me and bade me go either because of some message from Zeus or because her own mind was turned And she sent me on my way on a raft stoutly bound and gave me abundant store  of bread and sweet wine and clad me in immortal raiment and sent forth a gentle wind and warm So for seventeen days I sailed over the sea and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of your land and my heart was glad  ill-starred that I was for verily I was yet to have fellowship with great woe which Poseidon the earth-shaker sent upon me For he stirred up the winds against me and stayed my course and wondrously roused the sea nor would the wave suffer me to be borne upon my raft as I groaned ceaselessly  My raft indeed the storm shattered but by swimming I clove my way through yon gulf of the sea until the wind and the waves as they bore me brought me to your shores There had I sought to land the waves would have hurled me upon the shore and dashed me against the great crags and a cheerless place  but I gave way and swam back until I came to a river where seemed to me the best place since it was smooth of rocks and besides there was shelter from the wind Forth then I staggered and sank down gasping for breath and immortal night came on Then I went forth from the heaven-fed river  and lay down to sleep in the bushes gathering leaves about me and a god shed over me infinite sleepSo there among the leaves I slept my heart sore stricken the whole night through until the morning and until midday and the sun turned to his setting ere sweet sleep released me  Then I saw the handmaids of thy daughter on the shore at play and amid them was she fair as the goddesses To her I made my prayer and she in no wise failed in good understanding to do as thou wouldst not deem that one of younger years would do on meeting thee for younger folk are ever thoughtless  She gave bread in plenty and sparkling wine and bathed me in the river and gave me this raiment In this for all my sorrows have I told thee the truth Then in turn Alcinous answered him and saidStranger verily my daughter was not minded aright in this  that she did not bring thee to our house with her maidens Yet it was to her first that thou didst make thy prayer Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said Prince rebuke not for this I pray thee thy blameless daughter She did indeed bid me follow with her maidens  but I would not for fear and shame lest haply thy heart should darken with wrath as thou sawest it for we are quick to anger we tribes of men upon the earth And again Alcinous answered him and saidStranger not such is the heart in my breast  to be filled with wrath without a cause Better is due measure in all things I would O father Zeus and Athena and Apollo that thou so goodly a man and like-minded with me wouldst have my daughter to wife and be called my son and abide here a house and possessions would I give thee  if thou shouldst choose to remain but against thy will shall no one of the Phaeacians keep thee let not that be the will of father ZeusBut as for thy sending that thou mayest know it surely I appoint a time thereto even the morrow Then shalt thou lie down overcome by sleep and they shall row thee over the calm sea until thou comest  to thy country and thy house or to whatsoever place thou wilt aye though it be even far beyond Euboea which those of our people who saw it when they carried fair-haired Rhadamanthus to visit Tityus the son of Gaea say is the furthest of lands  Thither they went and without toil accomplished their journey and on the selfsame day came back home So shalt thou too know for thyself how far my ships are the best and my youths at tossing the brine with the oar-blade So said he and the much-enduring goodly Odysseus was glad  and he spoke in prayer and said Father Zeus grant that Alcinous may bring to pass all that he has said So shall his fame be unquenchable over the earth the giver of grain and I shall reach my native land Thus they spoke to one another  and white-armed Arete bade her maidens place a bedstead under cover of the portico and to lay on it fair blankets of purple and to spread there over coverlets and on these to put fleecy cloaks for clothing So they went forth from the hall with torches in their hands  But when they had busily spread the stout-built bedstead they came to Odysseus and called to him and said Rouse thee now stranger to go to thy rest thy bed is made Thus they spoke and welcome did it seem to him to lay him down to sleep So there he slept the much-enduring goodly Odysseus  on the corded bedstead under the echoing portico But Alcinous lay down in the inmost chamber of the lofty house and beside him lay the lady his wife who had strewn the couch
