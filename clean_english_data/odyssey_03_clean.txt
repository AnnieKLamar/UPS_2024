 And now the sun leaving the beauteous mere sprang up into the brazen heaven to give light to the immortals and to mortal men on the earth the giver of grain and they came to Pylos the well-built citadel of Neleus  Here the townsfolk on the shore of the sea were offering sacrifice of black bulls to the dark-haired Earth-shaker Nine companies there were and five hundred men sat in each and in each they held nine bulls ready for sacrifice Now when they had tasted the inner parts and were burning the thigh-pieces to the god  the others put straight in to the shore and hauled up and furled the sail of the shapely ship and moored her and themselves stepped forth Forth too from the ship stepped Telemachus and Athena led the way And the goddess flashing-eyed Athena spake first to him and said Telemachus no longer hast thou need to feel shame no not a whit  For to this end hast thou sailed over the sea that thou mightest seek tidings of thy father where the earth covered him and what fate he met But come now go straightway to Nestor tamer of horses let us learn what counsel he keepeth hid in his breast And do thou beseech him thyself that he may tell thee the very truth  A lie will he not utter for he is wise indeed Then wise Telemachus answered her Mentor how shall I go and how shall I greet him I am as yet all unversed in subtle speech and moreover a young man has shame to question an elder  Then the goddess flashing-eyed Athena answered him Telemachus somewhat thou wilt of thyself devise in thy breast and somewhat heaven too will prompt thee For methinks not without the favour of the gods hast thou been born and reared So spake Pallas Athena and led the way  quickly but he followed in the footsteps of the goddess and they came to the gathering and the companies of the men of Pylos There Nestor sat with his sons and round about his people making ready the feast were roasting some of the meat and putting other pieces on spits But when they saw the strangers they all came thronging about them  and clasped their hands in welcome and bade them sit down First Nestor's son Peisistratus came near and took both by the hand and made them to sit down at the feast on soft fleeces upon the sand of the sea beside his brother Thrasymedes and his father  Thereupon he gave them portions of the inner meat and poured wine in a golden cup and pledging her he spoke to Pallas Athena daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis Pray now stranger to the lord Poseidon for his is the feast whereon you have chanced in coming hither  And when thou hast poured libations and hast prayed as is fitting then give thy friend also the cup of honey-sweet wine that he may pour since he too I ween prays to the immortals for all men have need of the gods Howbeit he is the younger of like age with myself  wherefore to thee first will I give the golden cup So he spake and placed in her hand the cup of sweet wine But Pallas Athena rejoiced at the man's wisdom and judgment in that to her first he gave the golden cup and straightway she prayed earnestly to the lord Poseidon  Hear me Poseidon thou Earth-enfolder and grudge not in answer to our prayer to bring these deeds to fulfillment To Nestor first of all and to his sons vouchsafe renown and then do thou grant to the rest gracious requital for this glorious hecatomb even to all the men of Pylos  and grant furthermore that Telemachus and I may return when we have accomplished all that for which we came hither with our swift black ship Thus she prayed and was herself fulfilling all Then she gave Telemachus the fair two-handled cup and in like manner the dear son of Odysseus prayed  Then when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink the horseman Nestor of Gerenia spoke first among them Now verily is it seemlier to ask and enquire  of the strangers who they are since now they have had their joy of food Strangers who are ye Whence do ye sail over the watery ways Is it on some business or do ye wander at random over the sea even as pirates who wander hazarding their lives and bringing evil to men of other lands  Then wise Telemachus took courage and made answer for Athena herself put courage in his heart that he might ask about his father that was gone and that good report might be his among men Nestor son of Neleus great glory of the Achaeans  thou askest whence we are and I will surely tell thee We have come from Ithaca that is below Neion but this business whereof I speak is mine own and concerns not the people I come after the wide-spread rumor of my father if haply I may hear of it even of goodly Odysseus of the steadfast heart who once men say  fought by thy side and sacked the city of the Trojans For of all men else as many as warred with the Trojans we learn where each man died a woeful death but of him the son of Cronos has made even the death to be past learning for no man can tell surely where he hath died   whether he was overcome by foes on the mainland or on the deep among the waves of Amphitrite Therefore am I now come to thy knees if perchance thou wilt be willing to tell me of his woeful death whether thou sawest it haply with thine own eyes or didst hear from some other the story  of his wanderings for beyond all men did his mother bear him to sorrow And do thou nowise out of ruth or pity for me speak soothing words but tell me truly how thou didst come to behold him I beseech thee if ever my father noble Odysseus promised aught to thee of word or deed and fulfilled it  in the land of the Trojans where you Achaeans suffered woes be mindful of it now I pray thee and tell me the very truth Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia answered him My friend since thou hast recalled to my mind the sorrow which we endured in that land we sons of the Achaeans unrestrained in daring   all that we endured on shipboard as we roamed after booty over the misty deep whithersoever Achilles led and all our fightings around the great city of king Priam lo there all our best were slain There lies warlike Aias there Achilles  there Patroclus the peer of the gods in counsel and there my own dear son strong alike and peerless Antilochus pre-eminent in speed of foot and as a warrior Aye and many other ills we suffered besides these who of mortal men could tell them all  Nay if for five years' space or six years' space thou wert to abide here and ask of all the woes which the goodly Achaeans endured there thou wouldest grow weary ere the end and get thee back to thy native land For nine years' space were we busied plotting their ruin with all manner of wiles and hardly did the son of Cronos bring it to pass  There no man ventured to vie with him in counsel since goodly Odysseus far excelled in all manner of wiles thy father if indeed thou art his son Amazement holds me as I look on thee for verily thy speech is like his nor would one think  that a younger man would speak so like him Now all the time that we were there goodly Odysseus and I never spoke at variance either in the assembly or in the council but being of one mind advised the Argives with wisdom and shrewd counsel how all might be for the best  But when we had sacked the lofty city of Priam and had gone away in our ships and a god had scattered the Achaeans then even then Zeus planned in his heart a woeful return for the Argives for in no wise prudent or just were all Wherefore many of them met an evil fate  through the fell wrath of the flashing-eyed goddess the daughter of the mighty sire for she caused strife between the two sons of Atreus Now these two called to an assembly all the Achaeans recklessly and in no due order at set of sun and they came heavy with wine the sons of the Achaeans   and they spoke their word and told wherefore they had gathered the host together Then in truth Menelaus bade all the Achaeans think of their return over the broad back of the sea but in no wise did he please Agamemnon for he was fain to hold back the host and to offer holy hecatombs  that he might appease the dread wrath of Athena fool nor knew he this that with her was to be no hearkening for the mind of the gods that are forever is not quickly turned So these two stood bandying harsh words but the well-greaved Achaeans sprang up  with a wondrous din and two-fold plans found favour with them That night we rested each side pondering hard thoughts against the other for Zeus was bringing upon us an evil doom but in the morning some of us launched our ships upon the bright sea and put on board our goods and the low-girdled women  Half indeed of the host held back and remained there with Agamemnon son of Atreus shepherd of the host but half of us embarked and rowed away and swiftly the ships sailed for a god made smooth the cavernous sea But when we came to Tenedos we offered sacrifice to the gods  being eager to reach our homes howbeit Zeus did not yet purpose our return stubborn god who roused evil strife again a second time Then some turned back their curved ships and departed even the lord Odysseus the wise and crafty-minded with his company once more showing favour to Agamemnon son of Atreus  but I with the full company of ships that followed me fled on for I knew that the god was devising evil And the warlike son of Tydeus fled and urged on his men and late upon our track came fair-haired Menelaus and overtook us in Lesbos as we were debating the long voyage  whether we should sail to sea-ward of rugged Chios toward the isle Psyria keeping Chios itself on our left or to land-ward of Chios past windy Mimas So we asked the god to shew us a sign and he shewed it us and bade us cleave through the midst of the sea to Euboea  that we might the soonest escape from misery And a shrill wind sprang up to blow and the ships ran swiftly over the teeming ways and at night put in to Geraestus There on the altar of Poseidon we laid many thighs of bulls thankful to have traversed the great sea  It was the fourth day when in Argos the company of Diomedes son of Tydeus tamer of horses stayed their shapely ships but I held on toward Pylos and the wind was not once quenched from the time when the god first sent it forth to blow Thus I came dear child without tidings nor know I aught  of those others who of the Achaeans were saved and who were lost But what tidings I have heard as I abide in our halls thou shalt hear as is right nor will I hide it from thee Safely they say came the Myrmidons that rage with the spear whom the famous son of great-hearted Achilles led  and safely Philoctetes the glorious son of Poias All his company too did Idomeneus bring to Crete all who escaped the war and the sea robbed him of none But of the son of Atreus you have yourselves heard far off though you are how he came and how Aegisthus devised for him a woeful doom  Yet verily he paid the reckoning therefor in terrible wise so good a thing is it that a son be left behind a man at his death since that son took vengeance on his father's slayer the guileful Aegisthus for that he slew his glorious father Thou too friend for I see thou art a comely man and tall  be thou valiant that many an one among men yet to be born may praise thee Then wise Telemachus answered him Nestor son of Neleus great glory of the Achaeans yea verily that son took vengeance and the Achaeans shall spread his fame abroad that men who are yet to be may hear thereof  O that the gods would clothe me with such strength that I might take vengeance on the wooers for their grievous sin who in wantonness devise mischief against me But lo the gods have spun for me no such happiness for me or for my father and now I must in any case endure  Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia answered him Friend since thou calledst this to my mind and didst speak of it they say that many wooers for the hand of thy mother devise evils in thy halls in thy despite Tell me art thou willingly thus oppressed or do the people  throughout the land hate thee following the voice of a god Who knows but Odysseus may some day come and take vengeance on them for their violent deeds he alone it may be or even all the host of the Achaeans Ah would that flashing-eyed Athena might choose to love thee even as then she cared exceedingly for glorious Odysseus  in the land of the Trojans where we Achaeans suffered woes For never yet have I seen the gods so manifestly shewing love as Pallas Athena did to him standing manifest by his side If she would be pleased to love thee in such wise and would care for thee at heart then would many a one of them utterly forget marriage  Then wise Telemachus answered him Old man in no wise do I deem that this word will be brought to pass Too great is what thou sayest amazement holds me No hope have I that this will come to pass no not though the gods should so will it Then the goddess flashing-eyed Athena spoke to him and said  Telemachus what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth Easily might a god who willed it bring a man safe home even from afar But for myself I had rather endure many grievous toils ere I reached home and saw the day of my returning than after my return be slain at my hearth as Agamemnon  was slain by the guile of Aegisthus and of his own wife But of a truth death that is common to all the gods themselves cannot ward from a man they love when the fell fate of grievous death shall strike him down Then wise Telemachus answered her  Mentor no longer let us tell of these things despite our grief For him no return can ever more be brought to pass nay ere this the immortals have devised for him death and black fate But now I would make enquiry and ask Nestor regarding another matter since beyond all others he knows judgments and wisdom  for thrice men say has he been king for a generation of men and like unto an immortal he seems to me to look upon Nestor son of Neleus do thou tell me truly how was the son of Atreus wide-ruling Agamemnon slain Where was Menelaus What death did  guileful Aegisthus plan for the king since he slew a man mightier far than himself Was Menelaus not in Achaean Argos but wandering elsewhere among men so that Aegisthus took heart and did the murderous deed Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia answered him Then verily my child will I tell thee all the truth  Lo of thine own self thou dost guess how this matter would have fallen out if the son of Atreus fair-haired Menelaus on his return from Troy had found Aegisthus in his halls alive Then for him not even in death would they have piled the up-piled earth but the dogs and birds would have torn him  as he lay on the plain far from the city nor would any of the Achaean women have bewailed him for monstrous was the deed he devised We on our part abode there in Troy fulfilling our many toils but he at ease in a nook of horse-pasturing Argos ever sought to beguile with words the wife of Agamemnon  Now at the first she put from her the unseemly deed the beautiful Clytemnestra for she had an understanding heart and with her was furthermore a minstrel whom the son of Atreus straitly charged when he set forth for the land of Troy to guard his wife But when at length the doom of the gods bound her that she should be overcome  then verily Aegisthus took the minstrel to a desert isle and left him to be the prey and spoil of birds and her willing as he was willing he led to his own house And many thigh-pieces he burned upon the holy altars of the gods and many offerings he hung up woven stuffs and gold  since he had accomplished a mighty deed beyond all his heart had hoped Now we were sailing together on our way from Troy the son of Atreus and I in all friendship but when we came to holy Sunium the cape of Athens there Phoebus Apollo  assailed with his gentle shafts and slew the helmsman of Menelaus as he held in his hands the steering-oar of the speeding ship even Phrontis son of Onetor who excelled the tribes of men in piloting a ship when the storm winds blow strong So Menelaus tarried there though eager for his journey  that he might bury his comrade and over him pay funeral rites But when he in his turn as he passed over the wine-dark sea in the hollow ships reached in swift course the steep height of Malea then verily Zeus whose voice is borne afar planned for him a hateful path and poured upon him the blasts of shrill winds  and the waves were swollen to huge size like unto mountains Then parting his ships in twain he brought some to Crete where the Cydonians dwelt about the streams of Iardanus Now there is a smooth cliff sheer towards the sea on the border of Gortyn in the misty deep  where the Southwest Wind drives the great wave against the headland on the left toward Phaestus and a little rock holds back a great wave Thither came some of his ships and the men with much ado escaped destruction howbeit the ships the waves dashed to pieces against the reef But the five other dark-prowed ships  the wind as it bore them and the wave brought to Egypt So he was wandering there with his ships among men of strange speech gathering much livelihood and gold but meanwhile Aegisthus devised this woeful work at home  Seven years he reigned over Mycenae rich in gold after slaying the son of Atreus and the people were subdued under him but in the eighth came as his bane the goodly Orestes back from Athens and slew his father's murderer  the guileful Aegisthus for that he had slain his glorious father Now when he had slain him he made a funeral feast for the Argives over his hateful mother and the craven Aegisthus and on the self-same day there came to him Menelaus good at the war-cry bringing much treasure even all the burden that his ships could bear So do not thou my friend wander long far from home leaving thy wealth behind thee and men in thy house  so insolent lest they divide and devour all thy wealth and thou shalt have gone on a fruitless journey But to Menelaus I bid and command thee to go for he has but lately come from a strange land from a folk whence no one would hope in his heart  to return whom the storms had once driven astray into a sea so great whence the very birds do not fare in the space of a year so great is it and terrible But now go thy way with thy ship and thy comrades or if thou wilt go by land here are chariot and horses at hand for thee  and here at thy service are my sons who will be thy guides to goodly Lacedaemon where lives fair-haired Menelaus And do thou beseech him thyself that he may tell thee the very truth A lie will be not utter for he is wise indeed So he spoke and the sun set and darkness came on  Then among them spoke the goddess flashing-eyed Athena Old man of a truth thou hast told this tale aright But come cut out the tongues of the victims and mix the wine that when we have poured libations to Poseidon and the other immortals we may bethink us of sleep for it is the time thereto  Even now has the light gone down beneath the darkness and it is not fitting to sit long at the feast of the gods but to go our way So spoke the daughter of Zeus and they hearkenened to her voice Heralds poured water over their hands and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink  and served out to all pouring first drops for libation into the cups Then they cast the tongues upon the fire and rising up poured libations upon them But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart's content then verily Athena and godlike Telemachus were both fain to return to the hollow ship  but Nestor on his part sought to stay them and he spoke to them saying This may Zeus forbid and the other immortal gods that ye should go from my house to your swift ship as from one utterly without raiment and poor who has not cloaks and blankets in plenty in his house  whereon both he and his guests may sleep softly Nay in my house there are cloaks and fair blankets Never surely shall the dear son of this man Odysseus lie down upon the deck of a ship while I yet live and children after me are left in my halls  to entertain strangers even whosoever shall come to my house Then the goddess flashing-eyed Athena answered him Well indeed hast thou spoken in this old friend and it were fitting for Telemachus to hearken to thee since it is far better thus But while he shall now follow with thee that he may sleep  in thy halls I for my part will go to the black ship that I may hearten my comrades and tell them all For alone among them I declare that I am an older man the others are younger who follow in friendship all of them of like age with great-hearted Telemachus  There will I lay me down by the hollow black ship this night but in the morning I will go to the great-hearted Cauconians where a debt is owing to me in no wise new or small But do thou send this man on his way with a chariot and with thy son since he has come to thy house and give him horses  the fleetest thou host in running and the best in strength So spoke the goddess flashing-eyed Athena and she departed in the likeness of a sea-eagle and amazement fell upon all at the sight and the old man marvelled when his eyes beheld it And he grasped the hand of Telemachus and spoke and addressed him  Friend in no wise do I think that thou wilt prove a base man or a craven if verily when thou art so young the gods follow thee to be thy guides For truly this is none other of those that have their dwellings on Olympus but the daughter of Zeus Tritogeneia the maid most glorious she that honored also thy noble father among the Argives  Nay O Queen be gracious and grant to me fair renown to me and to my sons and to my revered wife and to thee in return will I sacrifice a sleek heifer broad of brow unbroken which no man hath yet led beneath the yoke Her will I sacrifice and I will overlay her horns with gold  So he spoke in prayer and Pallas Athena heard him Then the horseman Nestor of Gerenia led them his sons and the husbands of his daughters to his beautiful palace And when they reached the glorious palace of the king they sat down in rows on the chairs and high seats  and on their coming the old man mixed for them a bowl of sweet wine which now in the eleventh year the housewife opened when she had loosed the string that held the lid Thereof the old man bade mix a bowl and earnestly he prayed as he poured libations to Athena the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis  But when they had poured libations and had drunk to their heart's content they went each to his home to take their rest But the horseman Nestor of Gerenia bade Telemachus the dear son of divine Odysseus to sleep there on a corded bedstead under the echoing portico  and by him Peisistratus of the good ashen spear a leader of men who among his sons was still unwed in the palace But he himself slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house and beside him lay the lady his wife who had strewn the couch Soon as early Dawn appeared the rosy-fingered  up from his bed rose the horseman Nestor of Gerenia and went forth and sat down on the polished stones which were before his lofty doors white and glistening as with oil On these of old was wont to sit Neleus the peer of the gods in counsel  but he ere this had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades and now there sat upon them in his turn Nestor of Gerenia the warder of the Achaeans holding a sceptre in his hands About him his sons gathered in a throng as they came forth from their chambers Echephron and Stratius and Perseus and Aretus and godlike Thrasymedes  and to these thereafter came as the sixth the lord Peisistratus And they led godlike Telemachus and made him sit beside them and the horseman Nestor of Gerenia was first to speak among them Quickly my dear children fulfil my desire that first of all the gods I may propitiate Athena  who came to me in manifest presence to the rich feast of the god Come now let one go to the plain for a heifer that she may come speedily and that the neatherd may drive her and let one go to the black ship of great-hearted Telemachus and bring all his comrades and let him leave two men only  and let one again bid the goldsmith Laerces come hither that he may overlay the heifer's horns with gold And do ye others abide here together and bid the handmaids within to make ready a feast throughout our glorious halls to fetch seats and logs to set on either side of the altar and to bring clear water  So he spoke and they all set busily to work The heifer came from the plain and from the swift shapely ship came the comrades of great-hearted Telemachus the smith came bearing in his hands his tools of bronze the implements of his craft anvil and hammer and well-made tongs  wherewith he wrought the gold and Athena came to accept the sacrifice Then the old man Nestor the driver of chariots gave gold and the smith prepared it and overlaid therewith the horns of the heifer that the goddess might rejoice when she beheld the offering And Stratius and goodly Echephron led the heifer by the horns  and Aretus came from the chamber bringing them water for the hands in a basin embossed with flowers and in the other hand he held barley grains in a basket and Thrasymedes steadfast in fight stood by holding in his hands a sharp axe to fell the heifer and Perseus held the bowl for the blood Then the old man Nestor driver of chariots  began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains and earnestly he prayed to Athena cutting off as first offering the hair from the head and casting it into the fire Now when they had prayed and had strewn the barley grains straightway the son of Nestor Thrasymedes high of heart came near and dealt the blow and the axe cut through the sinews  of the neck and loosened the strength of the heifer Then the women raised the sacred cry the daughters and the sons' wives and the revered wife of Nestor Eurydice the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus and the men raised the heifer's head from the broad-wayed earth and held it and Peisistratus leader of men cut the throat  And when the black blood had flowed from her and the life had left the bones at once they cut up the body and straightway cut out the thigh-pieces all in due order and covered them with a double layer of fat and laid raw flesh upon them Then the old man burned them on billets of wood and poured over them sparkling wine  and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned and they had tasted the inner parts they cut up the rest and spitted and roasted it holding the pointed spits in their hands Meanwhile the fair Polycaste  the youngest daughter of Nestor son of Neleus bathed Telemachus And when she had bathed him and anointed him richly with oil and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic forth from the bath he came in form like unto the immortals and he went and sat down by Nestor the shepherd of the people  Now when they had roasted the outer flesh and had drawn it off the spits they sat down and feasted and worthy men waited on them pouring wine into golden cups But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink the horseman Nestor of Gerenia was first to speak saying  My sons up yoke for Telemachus horses with beautiful mane beneath the car that he may get forward on his journey So he spoke and they readily hearkened and obeyed and quickly they yoked beneath the car the swift horses And the housewife placed in the car bread and wine  and dainties such as kings fostered of Zeus are wont to eat Then Telemachus mounted the beautiful car and Peisistratus son of Nestor a leader of men mounted beside him and took the reins in his hands He touched the horses with the whip to start them and nothing loath the pair sped on  to the plain and left the steep citadel of Pylos So all day long they shook the yoke which they bore about their necks Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark And they came to Pherae to the house of Diocles son of Ortilochus whom Alpheus begot  There they spent the night and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers So soon as early Dawn appeared the rosy-fingered they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them and nothing loath the pair sped onward  So they came to the wheat-bearing plain and thereafter pressed on toward their journey's end so well did their swift horses bear them on And the sun set and all the ways grew dark
